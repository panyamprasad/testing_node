// TypeScript:
    // TypeScript is superset of javaScript, It's add the static typing, interfaces, classes
    // Using the types we can find the erros at compile time instend of run time.
    // Better code readability and maintanabulity.
        let age : number = 55; // age can hold only numbers can't assgin another type.
        let firstName = "prasad"; // name can hold only string.
    // Typescript will throw the error if we assgin any worng value.

// Difference between JavaScript & TypeScript?
    // JavaScript is the scripting language, we can run this in brower and nodeJs. TypeScript is superset of javeScript, we can declare the types staticly.
    // JavaScript verify the types at run time. Typescript verify it compile time.
    // In Js error will apper at run time. In TS it will apper at compile time.
    // Js directly execute using Js engine. In TS we should compiled using javaScript.
    // File Extenc .js.. In TS file extenstion .ts, .tsx.
    // In JS all ES6 feature will support. In TS types, interfaces, classes, decarators...

// Notes:
    // Compare to javaScript, typeScript is more scalable and imporve the performance.
    // Js using for scripting and small applications.
    // TS using for large applications and projects have multiple employeess.

// How types prevent runtime errors?
    // Compile time : In typeScript before running the errors will catch at complie time.
    // Function parameter: When we define the parameter type in function, ts will verify the correct usege at compile time.
    // Object Creation: In ts will define the type in object creation, here also will verify the correct properties.
