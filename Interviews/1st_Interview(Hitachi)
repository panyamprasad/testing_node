// --- First Interview (Hitachi) ---
// ---> 1. What is the disAdvantages of Lambda?
// 		1. Max Lambda execution time is only 15 min. If increase more than this it will give the time out error.
// 		2. Cold Start: It means if any lambda we didn't used for a while, it will go to the sleep mode, after some time we try to start it will take little more time for execution. Because it will start from scarch.
// 		3. Max Memory size is 10gb for lambda allocation, if required more than this it will throw the error.
// 		4. Deployment package size max 10mb, if required more we should store the data using s3.
//		-----------------------------------------------------------------------
// ---> 2. How to storage the file in S3? What is the process?
// 		1. To upload a file from the local system to Amazon S3, first we need to create an S3 bucket where the files will be stored.
// 		2. Each file in S3 is stored using a key (path) that acts like a unique file name or folder structure.
// 		3. In Node.js, we can use the built-in fs (file system) module to read the file from our local machine.
// 		4. Then we use AWS SDK or a pre-signed URL to upload the file to S3.
// 		5. Once the upload is successful, the file is stored as private by default, but we can make it public or generate a pre-signed URL to securely access it.
//		-----------------------------------------------------------------------
// --->	What is pre-signed url?
// ---> 3. What is the closure?
// 		A Closure allows an innerfunction to access the variables from it's outerscope, even the outerscope function scope execution is completed. This is possible because javascript keeps a reference outerscope in memory.
		
// 		For Example: We have the accountOpening funciton with minimum balance, after function execution is done, but it will return inner functions like deposit, withDraw, balanceEnquiry still have the access to get balance through the Closure. That's way the balance is stays in the memory.

// ---> 4. How to remove the duplicates from array using the closer?
			function removeDuplicat(){
				let seen = new Set();
				
				return function(arr){
					let unique = [];
					for(let value of arr){
						if(!seen.has(value)){
							seen.add(value);
							unique.push(value);
						}
					}
					return unique;
				};
			}
			const uniquevalue = removeDuplicat();
			console.log(uniquevalue([1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5]))
